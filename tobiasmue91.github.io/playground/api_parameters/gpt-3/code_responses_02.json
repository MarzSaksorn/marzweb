The input layer should have as many neurons as there are features in your dataset. The output layer should have one neuron for binary classification. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a hyperparameter that you can experiment with.\n\n2. Initialize the weights and biases for each layer randomly. You can use numpy to generate random numbers.\n\n3. Define the activation function for the hidden layer. The most commonly used activation function is the sigmoid function, but you can experiment with other functions such as ReLU or tanh.\n\n4. Define the loss function for the output layer. For binary classification, the most commonly used loss function is binary cross-entropy.\n\n5. Implement the forward propagation function. This function takes the input data, applies the weights and biases to each layer, and applies the activation function to the hidden layer.\n\n6. Implement the backpropagation function. This function calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases for each layer.\n\n7. Implement the training function using gradient descent. This function iteratively updates the weights and biases using the gradients calculated in the backpropagation function.\n\n8. Train the neural network on your dataset and evaluate its performance on a validation set.\n\n9. Experiment with different hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of neurons in the hidden layer, and number of epochs to find the best model for your dataset.\n\nKeep in mind that creating a neural network from scratch can be a challenging task, especially if you are new to machine learning.
