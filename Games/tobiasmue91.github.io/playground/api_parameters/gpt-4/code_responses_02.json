The code is well-structured, with three functions that handle fetching content, extracting information, and combining the previous two functions. The main part of the code demonstrates how to use a thread pool to execute the `scrape` function for each URL in the list, allowing for efficient scraping of multiple web pages simultaneously. The only minor issue is that the response is cut off at the end, but it does not affect the overall understanding of the code."

Imports the necessary libraries and defines the types for better readability.\n2. Defines the `fetch` function, which fetches the content of a given URL using an aiohttp session.\n3. Defines the `extract_data` function, which extracts the title and date from a given URL using BeautifulSoup and the aiohttp session.\n4. Defines the `scrape` function, which takes a list of URLs, creates an aiohttp session, and runs the `extract_data` function for each URL concurrently using asyncio.\n5. Defines the main block, which initializes a list of URLs, runs",
