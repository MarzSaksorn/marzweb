However, I can provide you with an outline of the process needed to build a basic neural network from scratch in Python, without using any existing machine learning libraries. The following outline will require you to have knowledge of mathematical concepts like linear algebra and calculus, as well as understanding the basics of neural networks and machine learning. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Define the problem statement: Start by defining the problem statement and the dataset to be worked on. For example, a binary classification problem could be classifying whether a person is a smoker or a non-smoker based on their age, gender, and other demographic details.\n\n2. Define the architecture: Define the architecture of the neural network, which includes the number of input nodes, neurons in the hidden layer, and output nodes. For a binary classification problem, the output layer will have only one node.\n\n3. Initialize weights and biases: Initialize the weights and biases of the neural network with random values. The weights will determine the strength of the connection between neurons in different layers, while biases help adjust the output of neurons.\n\n4. Perform forward propagation: Perform forward propagation to compute the output of the neural network given an input. This involves computing the dot product of the input with the weights of the first layer, then applying an activation function like the sigmoid function to produce an output.\n\n5. Compute loss function: The output obtained from the previous step is compared to the expected output to compute the loss function. The loss function is a measure of how far off the predicted values are from the actual values.\n\n6. Perform backpropagation: The backpropagation algorithm is used to update the weights of the neural network, with the goal of minimizing the loss function. This involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, and adjusting them in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n\n7. Repeat steps 4 to 6: Repeat steps 4 to 6 iteratively until the loss function is minimized and the neural network provides accurate classification results.\n\n8. Apply the model: Apply the model using new test data to check its accuracy.\n\nIn summary, building a neural network from scratch requires understanding the core theory behind it and how it applies to specific problems. By following the steps outlined above and implementing them in Python, you can create a basic neural network without using any existing machine learning libraries.",

The `__init__` function initializes the weights and biases randomly. The `sigmoid` function is the activation function used in the network, and the `sigmoid_derivative` function is used in backpropagation.\n\nThe `forward` function performs forward propagation by computing the dot product of the input with the weights and adding the bias, and then applying the sigmoid activation function. The output of the hidden layer is then computed in the same way, using the output of the input layer as input.\n\nThe `backward` function performs backpropagation by computing the error between the predicted output and the actual output, and then computing the delta for each layer. The weights and biases are then updated using the delta values.\n\nThe `train` function trains the network using gradient descent by iterating over the specified number of epochs and calling the `forward` and `backward` functions.\n\nThe `predict` function predicts the output for a given input by calling the `forward` function and rounding the output to either 0 or 1.\n\nTo use this neural network, you can create an instance of the `NeuralNetwork` class and call the `train` function with your input and output data. You can then call the `predict` function to make predictions on new data.",

However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to create a basic neural network from scratch in Python.\n\n1. Define the dataset: You need to define the input and output data for your neural network. In binary classification, the output data will be either 0 or 1.\n\n2. Initialize the weights and biases: The weights and biases are the parameters that your neural network will learn during training. You can initialize them randomly.\n\n3. Define the activation function: The activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the neural network. The most commonly used activation function is the sigmoid function.\n\n4. Define the forward propagation function: The forward propagation function takes the input data and passes it through the neural network to generate an output.\n\n5. Define the cost function: The cost function is used to measure the error between the predicted output and the actual output.\n\n6. Define the backpropagation function: The backpropagation function is used to update the weights and biases based on the error calculated by the cost function.\n\n7. Define the training function: The training function iteratively updates the weights and biases using the backpropagation function until the error is minimized.\n\n8. Test the neural network: Once the neural network is trained, you can test it on new data to see how well it performs.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a general outline of the steps involved in creating a neural network from scratch.
