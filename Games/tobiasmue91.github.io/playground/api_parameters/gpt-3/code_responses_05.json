Here's the code:\n\n```\nimport random\n\ndef get_user_choice():\n    \"\"\"Asks the user to enter their choice and returns it.\"\"\"\n    user_choice = input(\"Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): \")\n    return user_choice.lower()\n\ndef get_computer_choice():\n    \"\"\"Returns a random choice for the computer.\"\"\"\n    choices = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)\n    return computer_choice\n\ndef determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):\n    \"\"\"Determines the winner of the game and returns the result.\"\"\"\n    if user_choice == computer_choice:\n        return \"It's a draw!\"\n    elif user_choice == \"rock\" and computer_choice == \"scissors\":\n        return \"You win!\"\n    elif user_choice == \"paper\" and computer_choice == \"rock\":\n        return \"You win!\"\n    elif user_choice == \"scissors\" and computer_choice == \"paper\":\n        return \"You win!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Computer wins!\"\n\n# Main game loop\nwhile True:\n    user_choice = get_user_choice()\n    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()\n    print(f\"\\nYou chose {user_choice}.\")\n    print(f\"Computer chose {computer_choice}.\\n\")\n    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)\n    print(result)\n    play_again = input(\"Do you want to play again? (y/n): \")\n    if play_again.lower() != \"y\":\n        break\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define three functions:\n\n- `get_user_choice()`: This function asks the user to enter their choice and returns it.\n- `get_computer_choice()`: This function returns a random choice for the computer.\n- `determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`: This function takes the user's choice and the computer's choice as input, and determines the winner of the game. It returns the result as a string.\n\nIn the main game loop, we call these functions to play the game. We first ask the user for their choice, then get a random choice for the computer. We print both choices and determine the winner using the `determine_winner()` function. We then ask the user if they want to play again. If they don't, we break out of the loop and end the game.\n\nHere's an example of how the game might look like:\n\n```\nEnter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): rock\n\nYou chose rock.\nComputer chose scissors.\n\nYou win!\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): y\n\nEnter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): paper\n\nYou chose paper.\nComputer chose paper.\n\nIt's a draw!\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): n\n```",
