Otherwise, it initializes some variables to keep track of the minimum price seen so far (`min_price`), the maximum profit found so far (`max_profit`), and the buying and selling days that correspond to that profit (`buy_day` and `sell_day`).\n\nThen, the function iterates over the list of tuples, starting from the second element (`range(1, len(stock_data))`). For each element, it extracts the price and checks if it is lower than the current minimum price. If it is, it updates the minimum price accordingly. If it is not, it calculates the potential profit that could be made by buying at the minimum price seen so far and selling at the current price. If that profit is higher than the current maximum profit, it updates the maximum profit and the buying and selling days accordingly.\n\nNote that the function uses the `index` method of lists to find the index of the tuple that corresponds to the minimum price seen so far (`(min_price, i-1)`), since the `i` variable is the index of the current tuple, not the index of the tuple with the minimum price.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple with the buying day, the selling day, and the maximum profit found.\n\nWe can test the function with the example input:\n\n```python\nstock_data = [(0, 100), (1, 180), (2, 260), (3, 310), (4, 40), (5, 535), (6, 695)]\nprint(max_profit(stock_data))  # Output: (4, 6, 655)\n```\n\nThe output is `(",

We then loop through the remaining elements of `stock_data`, from day 1 to day `n-1`. In each iteration, we check if `stock_data[i]` represents a potential buy day. To be a valid buy day, the stock price on this day (`stock_data[i][1]`) must be lower than the lowest price seen so far (`stock_data[prev_min_price][1]`). If this condition is satisfied, we update the value of `prev_min_price` to be `i`, the index of this lower price.\n\n4.
