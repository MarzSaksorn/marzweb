Title: Developer.py Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through the usage of the `developer.py` Python script. This script creates standalone web tools by utilizing the GPT-4 AI model from OpenAI. The generated tool consists of an HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Python 3.x installed on your system.
*   The `openai`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `python-dotenv` packages installed. You can install them via pip:

    Copy code

    `pip install openai beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv`


Setting up the API key
----------------------

1.  Sign up for an API key from OpenAI ([https://beta.openai.com/signup/](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)).
2.  Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `developer.py` script.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file as follows:

    makefileCopy code

    `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`


Running the script
------------------

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the `developer.py` script.
2.  Run the script using Python:

    Copy code

    `python developer.py`

3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to input the tool's name and additional criteria. Press Enter twice after entering the last criterion.

Understanding the script
------------------------

The script performs the following steps:

1.  Asks for the name of the tool to be created.
2.  Asks for any additional criteria for the tool.
3.  Uses the GPT-4 AI model to generate a detailed outline of the tool based on the provided input.
4.  Generates the tool's implementation (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) using the GPT-4 AI model.
5.  Saves the generated tool as an HTML file in the "tools" directory.

Key functions
-------------

*   `get_tool_name()`: Gets the tool's name from the user.
*   `get_additional_criteria()`: Gets additional criteria from the user.
*   `get_description(tool_name)`: Generates a detailed outline of the tool using the GPT-4 AI model.
*   `get_tool_implementation(tool_name, outline, additional_criteria)`: Generates the tool's implementation based on the outline and additional criteria.
*   `save_tool(tool_name, implementation)`: Saves the generated tool as an HTML file in the "tools" directory.

Output
------

The script will output an HTML file in the "tools" directory with the name format `tool_name.html`.
